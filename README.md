# QuickAcess - A Student Database, but much QUICKER üåå

Your student database can now be accessed very quickly right through your very own terminal üñ•


# Controls 

*Accessed a Certain Class Functionality*
- `/traverse`: Allows the user to find a certain student's data
- `/remove`: Removes a certain student's data
- `/edit`: Allows the user to update a student's mark if necessary
- `/add`: Allows the user to add a new student
- `/quit`: Quits the program 

*Logging in Commands*
- `/user`: Creates an account to access the database 
- `/quit`: Exits the program

#Accessing the Database Functionality*
- `/add_class`: Allows a user to add a new class
- `/view_classes`: Allows a user to see all their classes 
- `/remove_class`: Removes a class from the database 
- `/access`: Allows a user to access one of their class's grades 
- `/quit`: Quits the program

# Extra Information 

Commands work both on Mac and Windows. 

When you add a class, you may be prompted again to add it again as there is a (class_size)th chance that the class index of the hashmap may be taken by another class, hence, overriding. Therefore, you may have to change the name of the class. You cannot quit this process.

After typing a command, you cannot quit the process until completed. This might be changed in the future. 

For full functionality, run "account.py" founded in the complete release files. Running "database.py" will only run half the program of which, you can only play with one general class. 

This program is made in Python üêç using the Trees data structure üå¥ and Hashmaps for more efficiency #Ô∏è‚É£

#Patches and Updates

- Mar 17: Fixed iteration and scripting bugs. Added new functionality for the complete release and added more print statments for guidance. Hashmaps were added for more efficiency and quick results.
