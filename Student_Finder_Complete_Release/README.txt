Made in Python. 

Python must be installed in order for this program to work.

If on Mac OS, python is installed by default and hence, can be accessed very simply by just running the file. 

If on Windows, python must be downloaded before from an external site. 

Commands stay the same for both operating systems.

Run account.py for the full function of the program.
